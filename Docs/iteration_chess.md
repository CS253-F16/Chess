ITERATION 1:
-------------------

 - Chess Board:
	 1. Board and Pieces:
		 1. We will work on the two parts separately, but in the same room, using two computers. Two people will be coding while the third will be doing a paired programming. 
	 2. Chess Rules:
		 1. Each of us will be coding different rules, such as the piece movement and winning conditions.
 - Player ID:
	 1. Since none of us have ever implemented a code like this, we will focus on setting up a server and assinging each user a player ID. This will be done together at one computer.
	
ITERATION 2:
--------------------
	
 - Playing with Others
	 1. Again, since none of us have ever implemented a code like this, we will work together to match random player IDs with one another so that they can play chess on the same board.
 - Diplomacies:
	 1. There are four total diplomacies that we came up with. They will be split up among the three of us.
 - Chat:
	 1. One person will work on the chat after the diplomacies are completed.
 - Account Registration and Login:
	 1. One person will work on the account registration and login features.
	
ITERATION 3:
-------------------
	
 - Match History:
	 1. One person will be able to work on recording match history along with setting up some sort of ELO system that everyone will contribute to.
 - Ranked Games:
	 1. One person should be able to complete this, making sure that the ranked play is separate from the casual play. This is also take into consideration the ELO system that was implented in the match history.
 - Move Highlights:
	 1. This should be a simple implementation that one person will work on.
 - Spectate:
	 1. One person should be able to accomplish this. The spectator will be put into the same chess game as two other people, but they will not be allowed to move any of the pieces.
 - Singleplayer Analysis:
	 1. One person should be able to accomplish this as well. 
 - Report and Handling Reports:
	 1. This should be able to be done by one person. 
 - Customization:
	 1. This is a super simple application that isn't higher priority because it just changes the color of the board. One person should be able to wrap this up.
