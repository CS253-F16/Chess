Responsibilities
-----------------------
	1. If anyone had a certain responsibility, it would have been Mike. He made the backgrounds of the pictures that we are using as pieces to be transparent.
	2. Tung worked on setting up the board on the client side with the input and Mike and James.

Complete
----------------
	1. So far, we have the board drawn out as well as the pieces. We can drag the pieces and play with ourselves, but the pieces can go anywhere we drag (even if it's an invalid move).

Incomplete
----------------
	1. We are still working on getting the backbone side of the chess board to work. We need to add the handling exceptions to our program to prevent players from making invalid moves.

Troubles
-------------
	1. We are having a hard time trying to figure out how the connection to the server is going to be implemented and how JavaScript can send information to the server.

Adjustments 
------------------
	1. The only adjustments that we had to make was how to display the board and the pieces on the client side. 

Burn
--------
	1. Technically, we haven't finished the first user story, because it was an epic story. The "burn" rate is pretty low for our team because we are still trying to figure out how to implement the game in python. We haven't had much time to work on it since our schedules don't match up very well. We met up about 4 times in two weeks for a few hours at a time. 
	2.  It's still going to take us a little bit longer to figure out the python side, but once we figure that out, the other applications shouldn't take us as long.

Iteration 2 Revised Plan
----------------------------------
	1. The first thing that we have to do is to finish the python side of the board. We will all work on this together since we aren't too sure what we are doing.
	2. After that, we will work together to make sure that the rules of chess are properly implemented. We will also work together to figure out how to give each person that goes to the website their own player ID, since none of us have ever done anything like that before.
	3. If we still have time in this iteration, we will again divide and conquer to set up the rematch, forfeit, claim victory on disconnect, etc.

Iteration 3 Revised Plan
----------------------------------
	1. For now, iteration 3 will start with implementing a chat feature.
	2. Once that is completed, we will add the feature to make an account/log in to the account.
	3. Then the match history for each player's account will be tracked.
	4. Anything else that we have time for will be worked on and hopefully completed.
