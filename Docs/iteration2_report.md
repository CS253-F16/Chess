Responsibilities
-----------------------
	1. Mike worked on the client side of the board. 
	2. Tung worked on how to transfer the chessboard data to the server and from the server to JavaScript.
	3. James worked on creating accounts and being able to log in to the website.

Complete
----------------
	1. The board is all drawn out, but making the game work is still being worked on.
	2. Users are able to create accounts, but cannot sign in with their username/password just yet.

Incomplete
----------------
	1. We are still working on getting the backbone side of the chess board to work. We need to add the handling exceptions to our program to prevent players from making invalid moves.
	2. We still have to figure out how to transfer the data to the server and from the server to JavaScript.
	3. Users are still not able to log in using their personal information.

Troubles
-------------
	1. We are having a hard time trying to figure out how the connection to the server is going to be implemented and how JavaScript can send information to the server.
	2. Using conditionals using the database is still taking time to learn.

Adjustments 
------------------
	1. The only adjustments that we had to make was how to display the board and the pieces on the client side.

Burn
--------
	1. The "burn" rate is pretty low for our team because we are still trying to figure out how to implement the game in python. Working separately seems to have had a better outcome thusfar.
	2. It's still going to take us a little bit longer to figure out the python side, but once we figure that out, the other applications shouldn't take us as long.

Iteration 3 Revised Plan
----------------------------------
	1. The account login information will be completed.
	2. A chat system will be implemented.
	3. The board will be finished.
	4. Players will be able to play a functioning game of chess.
	5. Then the match history for each player's account will be tracked.
