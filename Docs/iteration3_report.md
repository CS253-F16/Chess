Responsibilities
-----------------------
	1. Mike worked on the client side of the board. 
	2. Tung worked on how to transfer the chessboard data to and from the server to JavaScript.
	3. James worked on creating accounts and being able to log in to the website securly.

Complete
----------------
	1. The board is all drawn out, but no rules to the game have been implemented just yet.
	2. Users are able to create accounts, but cannot sign in with their username/password just yet. Not securely at least.
	3. Information can now be sent to and from the server.

Incomplete
----------------
	1. We are still working on getting the backbone side of the chess board to work. We need to add the handling exceptions to our program to prevent players from making invalid moves.
	2. We need to add the rules as well.
	3. We still have to figure out how to transfer the data to the server and from the server to JavaScript.
	4. Users are still not able to log in using their personal information.

Troubles
-------------
	1. Figuring out how to pull information from the data and compare it using conditionals is a challenge, but we are right there.

Adjustments 
------------------
	1. The only adjustments that we had to make was how to display the board and the pieces on the client side.

Burn
--------
	1. The "burn" rate is pretty low for our team because we are still trying to figure out how to implement the game in python. Working separately seems to have had a better outcome thusfar.
	2. It's still going to take us a little bit longer to figure out the python side, but once we figure that out, the other applications shouldn't take us as long.

Final Plan/Ending
----------------------------
	1. The board will be finished/rules will be implemented. Each of us will work on a different rule.
	2. Players will be able to play a functioning game of chess with another person.
	3. Then the match history for each player's account will be tracked.
	4. After match history is implemented, then a rank will be assigned to players.
